Data structures and algorithms constitute a rich set of advanced programming techniques that are vital for solving numerous complex computational problems encountered across a broad range of engineering disciplines. The objective of this course is to introduce rigorous programming theory and innovative thinking that can be applied to design and implement practical computational solutions. The course is divided into three parts. First, language concepts fundamental to C programming are introduced. In the remaining two parts, design aspects of data structures and algorithms and implementation of these in C are presented. Topics covered in this course include dynamic memory management, data types and bit operations, arrays, pointers (including function pointers), linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, heaps, hashing and sorting.

This course has built a great programming fundation for me and C becomes one of my favouriate programming language becuase C gives me more freedom and faster implmemtation. 
Specifically, I have learnt about memory management:
- Pointers 
- Function pointers
- Dynamic memory management
- Struct and Enums

In the rest course, I have learnt data structures including both linear and non-linear data structure, along with algorithm analysis in great detail.  For algorithms, we looked at its complexity, different sorting algorithms and graph oprations.
